# Real-Time-Weather-Dashboard
This is a simple real-time weather dashboard built with Python and Tkinter. It fetches current weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly GUI. You can also compare the weather between two cities, viewing temperature, humidity, and wind speed side-by-side.
